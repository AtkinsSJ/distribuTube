Project DistribuTube
====================

This is a probably insane attempt at creating a distributed video hosting
and sharing website. YouTube is increasingly taking control away from
video creators - DistribuTube is an attempt to give that control back.

What does all that mean?
------------------------

Rather than being a single website, DistribuTube will be hosted on an
unlimited number of separate sites, so that you are always free to host
your own if you wish. However, these sites will cooperate with each other,
so that you can subscribe to channels that are scattered about, and yet have
all their videos available in a single place.

Sounds difficult
----------------

Yes, it is. I admit I'm not sure the project will ever see the light of day,
but I feel I should give it a try anyway.
